# **About CubiCube** 

CubiCube is an exciting and challenging runner game where players take on the role of a cube and must navigate through a variety of obstacles to reach the end of the level. The game's unique cube-shaped character adds a new level of difficulty as players must strategically maneuver around obstacles that are nothing but cube's enemy cuboids.

The game features beautifully designed 3D levels with a vibrant color palette that immerses players in the action. 

The gameplay is fast-paced and requires quick reflexes and good timing. Players must avoid falling off the bridge, or they will have to start the level over.
